    "# Toward a Further Understanding of the Relationship Between Variables\n",
    "We've reviewed all the tools in statistics we need to push further into new territory. But before we start to apply this knowledge toward learning about the economic forces generating the data, we need to further develop our understanding of how statistics describes the relationship between variables. Economics describes the structural dependence between variables whereas statistics describes distributional dependence. Econometrics as about how to utilize statistics or distributional dependence to understand structural dependence. But more on this later. For now, let's retreat to the more familiar domain of statistics and distributional dependence.\n",

    "## Conditions Required for Regression\n",
    "1. Invertibility of $E[XX']$. $E[XX']$ is a $2\\times 2$ matrix and we need to be able to invert it! $E[XX']$ is invertible if and only if $X$ has no perfect collinearity, i.e., $\\nexists$ a non-zero  vector $c\\in\\boldsymbol{R}^2$ such that $P(X'c = 0)=1$. This is just a mathy way of saying that the components of $X$ can't be linear combinations of one another for \"everyone.\" In our example with $X=(1, X_1)$, this means that there is some variation in $X_1$, i.e., $Var[X_1]>0$. You can get this result by using the fact that the determinant of an invertible matrix is non-zero, and $det(E[XX'])=Var[X_1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking closer at invertibility\n",
    "Why is no perfect collinearity equivalent to invertibility of $E[XX']$? Recall that a matrix is invertible if and only if it is positive definite and symmetric. $E[XX']$ is clearly symmetric. So $E[XX']$ is invertible if and only if it is positive definite. A matrix $M$ is positive definite if for all $c\\neq 0$, $c'Mc>0$. In the case of $E[XX']$ this means that $c'E[XX']c>0$ for all $c\\neq 0$. Let's see if we can show the equivalence between this case and our definition of no perfect collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof.** $\\rightarrow$. Suppose we have no perfect collinearity in $X$. Then there does not exist $c\\neq 0$ such that $P(X'c=0)=1$. Therefore, for all $c\\neq 0$, $P(X'c=0)<1$. Therefore, $P(X'c\\neq 0)>0$. Then, using that $c'E[XX']c=E[c'XX'c]$, it must be that $E[c'XX'c]>0$ since $c'XX'c\\geq 0$ (this is just a sum of squares) and $P(X'c\\neq 0)>0$. $\\leftarrow$ Now suppose $E[XX']$ is invertible. Then it is positive definite and symmetric. Thus, for all $c\\neq 0$, $c'E[XX']c>0$. Furthermore, $E[c'XX'c]>0$. But since $c'XX'c\\geq 0$, in order for the strict inequality to hold, we must have $P(X'c\\neq 0) > 0$. Therefore, $P(X'c=0)<1$ for $c\\neq 0$. Or, $\\nexists c$ such that $P(X'c=0)=1$.\n",

    "### Equivalent conditions for invertibility\n",
    "Suppose $W$ is a square, $K\\times K$ matrix. The following conditions are equivalent to $W$ being invertible.\n",
    "1. If we further assume that $W$ is symmetric, then $W$ is invertible if and only if it is positive definite, where positive definite means for all $c\\neq 0$, $c'Wc>0$.\n",
    "2. $W$ has non-vanishing determinant, i.e., $det(W)\\neq 0$\n",
    "3. All eigenvalues of $W$ are positive, where an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is such that $Wc=\\lambda c$ for some $c\\neq 0$. \n",
    "4. $rank(W)=row(W)=col(W)=K$, where $row(\\cdot)$ and $col(\\cdot)$ denote the dimension of the row and column spaces (i.e., the number of linearly independent rows and columns), respectively. These are sometimes called the row or column ranks of the matrix. This condition is sometimes called \"the full rank condition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand invertibility of matrices, it is important to first remember the definition of invertibility for a function and then to notice that matrices can be considered linear mappings (i.e., linear functions). The intuition of invertibility of a matrix follows from recalling that a linear function is invertible if it is a bijective linear mapping. When a matrix is square and has full rank, then it is a bijective linear mapping, and therefore has an inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is a matrix is linear mapping? Consider a $N\\times K$ matrix $W$. You can take any vector $c$ of length $N$ and right multiply it by $W$ to obtain a vector of length $K$, e.g, $c'W = v$ for some $N\\times 1$ vector $c$ and $K\\times 1$ vector $v$. Thus, $W$ just represents a function $f:\\boldsymbol{R}^N\\to\\boldsymbol{R}^K$. In order for $f$ to be bijective, it needs to be one-to-one and onto, which translates into the matrix $W$ representing $f$ to be square and have columns/rows that are linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick example of non-invertibility\n",
    "Let $X=(1,X_1,X_2)'$ where $X_1$ takes on a value of 1 if male and 0 if female and $X_2$ takes a value of 1 if female and 0 if male. Thus, you can interpret $X_1$ as a binary indicator for male and $X_2$ as a binary indicator for female. Let $c=(-1, 1, 1)'$. Then $X'c=-1 + X_1 + X_2$ but since $X_1=1-X_2$, then $X'c = -1 + (1-X_2) + X_2 = 0$. Thus, we have shown $\\exists$ c such that $P(X'c=0)=1$, and there is perfect collinearity in $X$. Therefore $E[XX']$ is not invertible."

    "An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $\\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{X}$ must satisfy the equation $\\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{X}v = \\lambda v$ for some non-zero $v$. Therefore, $(I\\lambda - \\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{X})v=0$ and the matrix $(I\\lambda - \\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{X})$ is singular (i.e., not invertible) since $v\\neq 0$. Therefore $det(I\\lambda - \\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{X})=0$ and one can solve for values of $\\lambda$ using this equation. In our example, \n",

    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "We have covered the case where we've regressed $Y$ on a single regressor $X_1$ and a constant. This is univariate regression. But luckily, we've already explored regression by writing $X=(1,X_1)'$ as a vector. So now, just think that we have more regressors so that $X=(1,X_1,X_2,...,X_K)$ is a $K+1$ vector, i.e., that we have $K$ total regressors. Writing with $i$ subscripts this is $X_i = (1, X_{1,i},...,X_{K,i})'$.\n",

    "Because we have already solved for the linear regression parameters when $X_i$ is a vector, the math is the same, except the matrices and vectors are of a higher dimension. We still have $\\beta = E[XX']^{-1}E[XY]$ where $X$ is now a $(K+1)\\times 1$ vector. The OLS estimator of $\\beta$ is (in super matrix notation) $\\hat{\\beta}_N = (\\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{X}'\\boldsymbol{Y}$ where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is now an $N \\times (K+1)$ matrix. Note that $K=1$ is the univariate case from above.\n",

    "The main insight from multiple (or multivariate) linear regression is the interpretation of the parameters and how the parameters can change with the introduction of more explanatory variables. To help explain the intuition, let's consider the case when $K=2$, so that we have two explanatory variables, $X_{1,i}$ and $X_{2,i}$, and $X_i = (1, X_{1,i}, X_{2,i})'$. "

Next consider the linear regression of $Y$ on $X_2$, denoted $BLP(Y|X_2)$ and the linear regression of $X_1$ on $X_2$ as $BLP(X_1|X_2)$. Let the residual from these regressions be defined as $U \\equiv Y - X'\\beta$, $\\tilde{Y} \\equiv Y - BLP(Y|X_2)$ and $\\tilde{X}_1\\equiv X_1 - BLP(X_1|X_2)$.
